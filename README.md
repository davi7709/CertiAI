# CertiAI
This project is a full-stack application that allows users to generate, review, approve, or reject documents using artificial intelligence. Designed as a digital workflow solution, the system integrates OpenAIâ€™s GPT models to automate document drafting and uses a digital signature API (such as Clicksign) to securely handle electronic approvals.
